PineScript code most suitable for trading Cryptocurrencies and OIL 
I have created a script based on BollingerBands which is used mainly for Crypto and OIL trading and longer term portfolio allocation changes. It is used in combination with PineScript that has variables whose value is set manually in the script's ‘Inputs’ window. This allows us to change certain values (EMA or Bollinger Bands settings etc.) without having to change the script's code itself. This is a huge benefit for trading in which you need constantly to check several indicators with different settings.
